							<h3>What is WEEE?</h3>

							<p>The Waste Electrical or Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires countries to maximise separate collection and environmentally friendly processing of these items.</p>

							<p>In the UK, distributors (including retailers) must provide a system which allows all customers buying new electrical equipment the opportunity to recycle their old items free of charge.</p>

							<p>Those establishing their own take-back scheme must as a minimum offer all customers buying new electrical equipment free take back of their old electricals on a like-for-like basis.</p>

							<p>To remind you that old electrical equipment can be recycled, it is now marked with a crossed-out wheeled bin symbol.</p>

							<p>Please do not throw any electrical equipment (including those marked with the crossed out wheeled bin symbol) in your bin.</p>


							<h3>Why Recycle?</h3>

							<p>Unwanted electrical equipment is the UKs fastest growing type of waste. Many electrical items can be repaired or recycled, saving natural resources and the environment. If you do not recycle, electrical equipment will end up in landfill where hazardous substances will leak out and cause soil and water contamination â€“ harming wildlife and also human health.</p>


							<h3>We can help</h3>

							<p>If you're buying a new electrical item, we will recycle your old one for free, please contact us for further details on how to return an item.</p>
